# Introducing Research Computing’s new NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip

In this 30-minute RC Quick Byte*, we will provide an overview of the 
cutting-edge capabilities of NVIDIA's Grace Hopper (GH200) Superchip, 
including how to request access and deploy software on the GH200s hosted 
by CU Research Computing. The GH200 is designed to revolutionize 
high-performance computing by providing shared memory between the CPU 
and GPU. This design can be useful for a large range of data-intensive 
applications and has proven fruitful for Machine Learning and Artificial 
Intelligence workloads. This introductory talk is useful for anyone curious 
about recent advancements in computing or individuals interested in using 
Research Computing’s GH200 nodes.

* _What’s an RC Quick Byte?: An RC Quick Byte is a 20-30 minute sessions 
intended to provide essential information about a specific topic. You can 
expect to leave a 'Quick Byte' with the information you need to apply a 
tool, service, or concept.
